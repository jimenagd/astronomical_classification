# Astronomical Classification
Multiclass classification for astronomical radiation sources 

This is a tutorial to my classification project on astronomical radiation sources. I am not a professional or expert in Python, but I had fun making this and I wanted to not just post it but make it accessible and understandable to beginners like me. I explained it the way I understood it when I learned about this and from researching online, so it may not be as accurate as an expert would be in explaining it. Nonetheless, I hope it's helpful in some way and that it interests you! :)

This project was inspired and challenged by The Photometric LSST Astronomical Time-Series Classification Challenge (PLAsTiCC) on Kaggle. If you are looking in depth into this project, I would recommend you read through the introduction and explanation of the challenge here: https://www.kaggle.com/c/PLAsTiCC-2018

In very short, it's a challenge in providing The Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) a way to rapidly classify data it will encounter (20-40 terabytes every night). My intention was to use this open source data to explore machine learning and classification applications. It's interesting to see how it can be applied to a real life challenge like that of telescope data reading. 

To interact with the code, you will need to download all the files I have attached. 
I seperated the project into different sections, representing different steps or ways to approach the data: feature selection, cross validation, logistic regression, multiclass classification, and neural networks. The logistic regression file is done in binary classification, while the multiclass is done in multiclass classification using logistic regression. If you wish to only look through certain sections, I recommend always starting with feature selection to understand where the data came from.
